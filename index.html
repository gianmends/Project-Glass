<h2> What is it </h2>
<p> The <b> Google Glass </b> is an accessory in the form of glasses that allows users to interact with various contents in augmented reality. Also called <b> <a href="https://www.google.com/glass/start/" target="_blank"> Project Glass</a></b>, the electronic is capable of taking pictures from voice commands, send instant messages and perform video conferences. Its launch is scheduled for 2014, and its price should be US$ 1,500. <b> Google Glass </b> is currently in the testing phase and already has a fully recorded video with the device. In addition, the search company filed new anti-theft and screen unlock patents for the accessory.</p>

<h2> How it works </h2>
<p> According to sources close to Google, the glasses will feature a small LCD or AMOLED screen at the top and in front of the user's eyes. With the use of a camera and GPS, you can locate yourself, as well as select options with the movement of your head. </p>

<h2> What you can do with Google Glass </h2>
Google's promotional video shows that you can become a kind of "superhuman", as the device can indicate how many meters you are from your destination, whether the subway is open or closed, show the weather, schedule and even allow you to arrange meetings with just voice commands. </p>

<h1> News on Glass </h1>
<p> Google finally revealed the complete specifications of the <b> Google Glass </b>, and with it a surprise still unpublished in the market: the search giant will use an audio system based on transduction by conduction. Through the temples of the glasses, the sound will be transmitted to the user's ear through microvibrations in certain bones of his head, without using any type of speaker. </p>

<p> In addition to the audio surprise, the screen mounted in front of the user's eye also drew attention. There will be 640 x 360 pixels of resolution which, in proportion, would be equivalent to a 25-inch high-definition monitor placed 2.5 meters away from the viewer. </p>
